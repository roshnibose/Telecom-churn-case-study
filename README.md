Telecom churn case study: 
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. We will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

Conclusion: Final Recommendations:

a) Target the customers, whose outgoing others charge in July and incoming others on August are less.
b) The customers having value based cost in the action phase increased are more likely to churn than the other customers. Hence, these customers may be a good target to provide offer.
c) Customers, whose monthly 3G recharge in August is more, are likely to be churned.
d) Target the customers, whose minutes of usage of the incoming local calls and outgoing ISD calls are less in the action phase (mostly in the month of August).
e) Customers having decreasing incoming minutes of usage for operators T to fixed lines of T for August are more likely to churn.
f) Cutomers decreasing monthly 2g usage for August are most probable to churn.
g) Customers having decreasing incoming minutes of usage for operators T to fixed lines of T for August are more likely to churn.
